            entrepreneurs within South Africa and abroad. Over the duration of their courses, students engage in various research activities, 
            which adequately prepare them for the job market.

            Over the past years, we have set ourselves high professional standards, by interacting with leading institutions 
            in the country, and by obliging our lecturers to keep track with changes in systems and methods of instruction.

            enacting changes as required by the South African Qualification Authority (SAQA).
