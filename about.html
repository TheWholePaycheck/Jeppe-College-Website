                have successfully completed courses in various fields and many of them have either found employment or have
                resultantly gained promotions at their work places.
                
                The idea of establishing a learning centre was conceptualized in 1997. The concept has now grown into a large institution,
                with six branches, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Pietersburg, & Vereeniging. All centers are fully-fledged
                learning institutions, catering for all various learning programmes in both Information Technology Systems and Business Studies.

                <br>

                Over the past years, we have set ourselves high professional standards, by interacting with leading institutions
                in the country, and by obliging our lecturers to keep track with changes in systems and methods of instruction.
